      <h1>Formative Assessment: Multiple Choice Questions</h1>
      <h2>Well-made multiple choice questions let you perform a differential diagnosis of student misconceptions on the fly, so you can adjust your lesson accordingly. In this activity, your students will practice constructing a formative MCQ, and think about how to use them in a classroom setting.</h2>

          <h2>Steps for the Activity</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Lead the class through an example of what a good MCQ looks like:
                <div class='well example'><ul>
                  <li><strong>3-5 answers</strong> is a reasonable range of options.</li>
                  <li><strong>Plausible distractors</strong>: wrong answers shoudn't be obviously wrong.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Concept motivation:</strong> Each wrong answer should be motivated by a specific misconception.</li>
                </ul></div>
                A classic example is 27+35, with answers: 62 (correct); 52 (didn't carry); 512 (didn't regroup); and 53 (carried to same column).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Create a new three-minute lesson, as well as an MCQ to test comprehension and misconceptions in that material. (20 min)</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Repeat the usual 3-person group exercise of teaching, observing and filming. After each lesson, have the observer answer the MCQ, and discuss.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> ask a couple of students to write their MCQs on the board, and discuss their distractors.</li>

            <li>
              <p>Finally, practice what you preach by asking the class the following MCQ:</p>
              <div class='well example'>
                <strong>Q: What is the main goal of polling your class with a formative MCQ?</strong>
                <p>a. To assess how student are interpreting the concepts presented & reconciling them with existing information <i>(no; misconception: MCQ just for assessment)</i></p>
                <p>b. To identify the weakest students for extra help from helpers <i>(no; misconception: MCQ doesn't affect instructor action, doesn't use info about specific misconceptions)</i></p>
                <p>c. To measure the fraction of the class who understand the lesson before moving on <i>(no; misconception: doesn't use info about specific misconceptions)</i></p>
                <p>d. To inform the most effective way of continuing the lesson <i>(yes. Formative assessment is ultimately about delivering effective lessons; the other points are all means to this end)</i></p>
