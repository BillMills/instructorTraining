          <h2>Steps for the Activity (1h 30 min)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Find a partner teaching the same topic as you. Using the concept maps and ideas you've worked on so far, work together to create a 10-minute lesson on part of your topic (30 min).</li>
            <li>
              Find another pair, and have each person take turns delivering the lesson they created with their partner. At each turn, have the presenter's partner film them, and the other pair act as students. Students should provide feedback after each lesson, using whichever feedback method they prefer. After your lesson, discuss with your partner how their delivery & interpretation of the lesson differed from your own (1 h).
