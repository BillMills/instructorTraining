      <h2>In order to reach our students, we have to think about who they are and how they might receive the things we say. In this exercise, students will reflect on their own experiences, and try to empathize with their prospective students.</h2>

          <h2>Steps for the Activity</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Reflect on a time you were de-motivated from participating or continuing in some endeavor. What caused you to withdraw? What could have been done differently to avoid this? What could have been done to address the situation after the fact? <i>You will not be required or asked to share this story in any way; reflect on it in detail privately, and think about how to do better in your own teaching.</i></li>
            <li> Create a 'model learner' profile for a student you imagine might come to a workshop you teach. What is their scientific background? What do they know about coding? Why are they coming to your workshop? What are some experiences they have had working with code in the lab? <i>This, and only this, exercise will be part of what we share & work with in the next lesson.</i>
            </li>

            After this lesson, learners should have spent some time reflecting on past experiences with demotivation, and have created a fictional profile for a student they might encounter.
