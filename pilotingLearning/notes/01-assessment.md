#Piloting Learning - Assessment & Adaptation

By sticking rigidly to a script, whether it's a textbook, a set of notes or a lesson plan, we are essentially planning ourselves into a corner; that process relies on us being able to make reliable assumptions of our learners' knowledge (which we generally can't), relies on our learners all having very similar needs so they can be served with the same lesson (which they generally can't), and relies on us skillfully constructing (luckily guessing?) what an adequate delivery technique will be. Instead, we want to conduct a more adaptive lesson; one that focuses on identifying & addressing our learners' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge in situ, and gives them multiple distinct opportunities to construct knowledge and understanding accurately and for themselves.
