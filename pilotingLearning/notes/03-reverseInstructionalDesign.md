#Reverse Instructional Design

Two of the characteristics we want for our lessons are better reliability and better targeting, compared to what we get by stepping linearly through a fixed text from a starting point that may not fit our learners, through content that may be tangential to our key goals, and towards a conclusion at an often arbitrary point in the curriculum imposed by running out of time.
If we take reliable learning outcomes as our starting point, a simple line of logic assembles itself.

In order to even attempt to assert that our teaching has a reliable outcome, we must first decide what skill, knowledge or understanding we want our students to acquire, and we must create some way of assessing the students in order to demonstrate that they did indeed assimilate that lesson.
At which point we've set up a measurable task for our students and can ask the question, 'what will a student have to master from our lessons before being able to succeed at this task?' - and we can keep asking that question of all the dependencies we identify in this manner, until we arrive at a set of skills & knowledge we believe we can safely assume our students come to us with a priori.

Play that chain backwards in class, and you've got a lesson plan that starts with assumptions about your learners at the per-skill (rather than per-textbook chapter) level, thus being well targeted to your students, and steps efficiently through concepts towards the ultimate learning goal, thus being as reliable as possible.
This process is in essence *Reverse Instructional Design*, and it represents an alternative in lesson design to proceeding linearly between fixed points in a text.

##Procedure & Example

A typical implementation of reverse instructional design may go something like this:

**Sketch a Concept Map.** As discussed in previous lessons, concept maps are always helpful for laying out a large topic so that connections can be tracked and scope can be controlled. Here's my quickie concept map surrounding some ideas in the bash shell:

**Identify Goals.** Reverse instructional design is all about starting from where you want to get to. Choose the node or nodes on your concept map that you want students to have a clear understanding of after your lesson. Come up with some exercises or activities that will allow students to prove that they have mastered the target concept.

**Characterize learners.** When we think about concepts at the level of nodes on a concept map, we've got the flexibility to better match where our students are coming from. It can often be helpful to imagine a character that you think represents your student's experience and knowledge; in this way, you can not only match your learners well, but sometimes gain some insight into how they will react to lessons, activities and ideas. For example:

"Jennifer is a successful mid-career ecologist who has done most of her analysis using spreadsheet software. She's come to this class to learn how to augment her practice with a scripting language."

From this character, I can make an informed guess of what concepts are already understood; if I expect to have a room full of people with similar experiences to Jennifer, I might choose a few concepts from my map as starting knowledge:

**Follow a path**, from back to front. At this point, the lesson plan pretty much writes itself. Choose a path to get learners from where they are, to where they need to be - note that it's not necessary to touch on every node in the map right away!

##Perils

Reverse instructional design has great strengths in efficiently guiding students from where they are to where we want them to be - but there are some pitfalls in too fervently fixing our gaze on outcomes.

**If you run out of time, you run out of time.** A big part of reverse instructional design is mapping efficient routes to learning, without the distractions and detours inherent in plodding through every page of a topic textbook. But no matter how you plan your lessons, sometimes you just run out of time; discourse that takes a life of its own not only happens - it's the hallmark of an engaging learning experience. And if taking the time you need to facillitate that engagement and reinforce every concept well means you don't actually get to the stated destination, so be it. Remember: you are up there to *teach* - not to teach a particular topic. Smart lesson planning can help your students keep pace; racing to a premeditated goal will just leave them behind.

**Beware 'teaching to the test'.** Reverse instructional design emphasizes examining what students will need to learn in order to be able to successfully complete the final assessment determining if they reached the learning goals. This can sound dreadfully close to 'teaching to the test' - giving students so narrow a focus that they are able to navigate the final exam, and little else. The key difference is that instead of training students on rote problems to be duplicated on the final assessment, reverse instructional design done well builds up the student's concept map with enough strength that they can navigate new challenges using what they learned in the course; see to it that your final assessment includes such novelty, and we protect ourselves from teaching mere exam strategy.
