#Piloting Learning - Introduction

Undergraduate course design often seems to go more or less like:

 1. Select a textbook.
 2. Before the first lecture, digest the first couple chapters into some lecture notes.
 3. Present the lecture notes over a week of lectures.
 4. Assign homework exercises from that portion of the text that was covered that week.

And repeat 2-4 until the end of the allotted time for the course, with some midterms sprinkled in the middle and a final at the end. On its surface, not totally unreasonable; a logically written textbook can scaffold a semester of conversation pretty easily. But:

 - Are you sure that textbook & lecture series started in the right place for your learners? Faculty (should) know better than to trust a course's prerequisites to reflect their learners' knowledge - and a workshop instructor has an even foggier picture of where students are coming from.
 - Did the homework help deepen students' understanding - or just cement skills by rote?
 - How well can you predict what students will know by the end of the course? If the students can't follow the text at the premeditated speed and the instructor's only options are to slow down or abandon her students, learning goals may never be reached.
 - What mechanisms exist to give students additional pathways to understanding, beyond what's presented in the book?

These situations and pitfalls are common products of this 'march-through' approach to lesson design. We would like our instruction to be better *targeted*, more *constructive*, more *reliable* and more *adaptable* - but how?

A couple of tools will let us reach for our ambition. In this unit, we'll learn about *reverse instructional design*, which will help with targeting and reliability, and about *summative vs. formative assessment*, which will help our lessons be more constructive and adaptable.
