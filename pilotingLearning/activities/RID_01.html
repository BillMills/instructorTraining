          <h2>Steps for the Activity</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Have students independently draw a concept map of a topic they're likely to teach; try and pick a relatively broad topic (Git? the bash shell?) that can produce a rich concept map with plenty of nodes and connections.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Choose a single node on the map as the final goal, something a little advanced (perhaps 'pull requests' for Git or 'scripting' for the bash shell). Devise a question or activity that will reveal if a student has learned this concept.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Create a characature of a student's experience. Use that character to identify which nodes on your concept map are reasonable starting points.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Finally, make a high-level lesson plan by tracing a route from where your learners begin, to where you want them to be. Is there more than one way to accomplish this? Are there some nodes you didn't need to touch on?</p>
            </li>
