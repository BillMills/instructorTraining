      <h1>Structured Feedback</h1>
      <h2>Feedback is most effective when it's structured. In this activity, learners will practice giving feedback in the 'outside-in' formalism, and with a rubric.</h2>

          <h2>Steps for the Activity (1 h 15 min)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Ask students to devise a new 10 minute lesson on the topic they've been teaching (30 min).</li>
            <li>Have students assemble groups of 3; one person presents, one listens, and one records. Listener then gives feedback broken down along the three categories of outside-in: physical, presentation and content, and recorder gives feedback based on the 'Medium' version of <a href='http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/rubrics/'>this rubric</a> (45 min).</li>
            <li>Reconvene the class, and collect some examples of feedback; these can serve as a collection of things to look for when doing outside-in style feedback.</li>
          </ol>

            After this lesson, learners should be familiar with the basics of the outside-in and rubric formalisms of giving feedback, and should have lists of physical, presentation and content criticisms to look for in future.
