      <h2>Concept Maps are a useful tool for systematizing learning & teaching. In this activity, learners will practice drawing concept maps, using them to frame their teaching, and examining them to gain insight into someone else's thinking.</h2>

          <h2>Part 1 - Drawing Concept Maps (30 min)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Ask students to independently draw a concept map on one of the major topics covered in your workshop (about 10 min).</li>
            <li>After they're finished drawing, pair students up who worked on the same topic, and ask them to discuss the differences between their maps. How would you combine the two?</li>
            <li>Randomly select a student to draw their concept map in front of the class, with no explanation.</li>
            <li>While the student is drawing, ask the class how many drafts they did, and what changed between drafts.</li>
            <li>Finally, ask if anyone has a very different map for the same topic, compared to the one drawn on the board; discuss.</li>

          <h2>Part 2 - Using & Reading Concept Maps (30 min)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Ask students to come up with some patterns that can help students chunk information belonging to one node on their map, and think of a short exercise to test a connection. (10 min)</li>
            <li>Ask students to divise a three-minute lesson using the patterns and exercise they created. (10 min)</li>
            <li>Assemble students in groups of three, and have them take turns teaching a three-minute lesson from the first section of material they drew their concept map for, that uses the patterns they devised and leads to the challenge problem they created. One student teaches; one tapes the instructor on the instructor's phone; and the third acts as the 'student' - repeat this pattern three times so everyone gets a chance at each role. (10 min)</li>

            After this lesson, learners should be familiar with drawing concept maps, using them to inform some basic teaching patterns around memory management, and examining the concept maps of others to identify differences in understanding.
