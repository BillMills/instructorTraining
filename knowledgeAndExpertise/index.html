        <h1 id='Introduction'>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Traditionally, software development skills are aquired somewhat tangentially by many scientists; mandatory formal training in coding is often minimal, and we as scientists accumulate a personal culture and practice of coding via day-to-day interactions with code, centered around mission-critical needs as they arise. But as software becomes a more and more integral tool for doing science, it behooves us to develop a familiarity with some of the foundational methods of software developers that go beyond the immediate and apparent; the use of version control, proficiency with databases, scripting, modularity, and building for reuse. I propose we set our sights on a simple standard:</p>

        <div class='well'>Scientific software should support <strong>transparent, automated & reproducible</strong> analyses via <strong>sharable & reusable</strong> code.</div>

        <p>These goals require the introduction of some new tools to the scientific toolbelt. What's more, they involve a level of proficiency that is essentially impossible to achieve in a short workshop; further practice is required on the part of the learner, and that practice represents an up-front investment that must be well motivated. They do not, however, require us to become master software developers. Just as every scientist need not be a publishing statistician but should have a firm grasp of the statistical methods used to analyze data in their field, we want to introduce the skills and ideas that support our goal, without abandoning pragmatism.</p>

        <p>So - a few questions fall to us as instructors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How can we introduce new ideas in a systematic way, that makes them usable as quickly as possible?</li>
          <li>What do we have to do to build fluency in these ideas, without overshooting into the realm of mastery?</li>
          <li>How can we build and manage motivation to keep students engaged while they invest in practicing with these new ideas?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this lesson, we'll address the first two by learning how to build functional representations of knowledge, and thinking about the nature of fluency and mastery.</p>

<!-- =============================== -->


<!-- Concept Maps -->
        <h1 id='A-Cartoon-of-Knowledge'>A Cartoon of Knowledge</h1>
        <p>Two things are required to paint even the most elementary picture of knowledge:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Ideas.</strong> The core concepts themselves, like the filesystem, a command, or a variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Connections</strong> between ideas. The linkages that allow us to infer, construct lines of logic, and build functioning methodologies. A shell command is related to the filesystem, for example, via its executional context.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This representation of knowledge can easily be drawn as a graph; here's an example:</p>
        <img src='conceptMap.jpg'></img>

        <p>We can cast a useful abstraction of teaching & learning as the construction of these graphs of ideas and connections.</p>

        <p>Often, teaching only recites the bubbles - presenting ideas without relating them to one another in a broader framework. This is perilous for students for a couple of reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Short term memory only holds about 7 (ish) unrelated facts reliably. Consider the number of digits in a phone number, or the number of teammates concurrently on the field in most sports; beyond about a half dozen things, it gets hard to keep track. But if there are connections between objects, functional relationships and association can help reinforce knowledge. For example, what's easier to remember: a list of a thousand random words, or the numbers one to one thousand?</li>
          <li>Like it or not, students will form relationships between ideas - but there's no guarantee they will independently come up with correct and useful relationships! And it's these relationships that allow students to perform more sophisticated and operational tasks than facts alone. If the relationships are wrong, their attempts to use their knowledge will fail.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In other words, structuring knowledge gives us a vehicle to reinforce memory, and maximize its usability. In what follows, we'll explore a little about each.</p>

        <h2>Using Memory</h2>
        <p>Short term memory is the beachhead ideas find themselves on when they are first presented to students. As mentioned above, its capacity is very small, and as the name suggests, it doesn't persist long. How can we help shepherd information from short term into long term memory?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>One key technique is called <strong>chunking</strong>. Short term memory can only handle about 7 facts at a time - but what counts as a fact? Just as you recognize your name as your name and not a string of independent letters, we can squeeze some extra capacity out of short term memory if we present information in patterns students can recognize. Dr. Seuss was a master of this technique in teaching reading; the real power of the doctor's writing was not so much in learning every word in the book, but in assimilating the several phonetics patterns that made the text parsable for new readers. In the same way, we interface with our students' short term memories better if all the things we say reinforce a small number of patterns and messages.</li>

          <li><strong>Break your lesson up</strong> as much as possible with questions and activities. Traditional lecture style teaching for an hour or more often far exceeds the short term memories of the students subjected to it. One of the elements of transferring information into long term memory is using it. Ask your students to answer short problems, discuss what they've learned with their peers, or respond to questions in order to get them to actively use their new knowledge. Using knowledge to overcome challenges helps students build the connections in their concept maps that helps information persist, and doing activities lets the students spend time cementing knowledge rather than listening to things they're going to forget.</li>

          <li><strong>Live code</strong>. Writing code live in front of your learners has several benefits:
            <ul>
              <li>The scale of code written live - probably no more than a few lines - matches the scale of short term memory better than instantly overwhelming them by popping a 200 line script onto the overhead.</li>
              <li>Writing code live forces the instructor to slow down, lets students consider each element at a time, and match the patterns they've already seen.</li>
              <li>Learners get to see our process; watching the instructor assemble a small piece of code illustrates those relationships on the concept map in real time.</li>
              <li>Learners get to see us make mistakes. This is tangential to memory, but it is vital because it lets our students see that people they regard as professionals are not so different from themselves, and their own struggles make them equal to, rather than lesser than. Also, watching us recover from mistakes is a rare privilege - most teaching only steps through things working as they should, and does little to demonstrate recovery.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p>We can summarize these points in context with our concept map as follows:</p>

        <div class='well'>
          <ul>
            <li>Reinforce concepts by repetition and patterns</li>
            <li>Reinforce connections by frequent exercises and activities</li>
            <li>Regulate pace and scope of examples with live coding</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
