        <h1 id='Introduction'>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Traditionally, software development skills are aquired somewhat tangentially by many scientists; mandatory formal training in coding is often minimal, and we as scientists accumulate a personal culture and practice of coding via day-to-day interactions with code, centered around mission-critical needs as they arise. But as software becomes a more and more integral tool for doing science, it behooves us to develop a familiarity with some of the foundational methods of software developers that go beyond the immediate and apparent; the use of version control, proficiency with databases, scripting, modularity, and building for reuse. I propose we set our sights on a simple standard:</p>

        <div class='well'>Scientific software should support <strong>transparent, automated & reproducible</strong> analyses via <strong>sharable & reusable</strong> code.</div>

        <p>These goals require the introduction of some new tools to the scientific toolbelt. What's more, they involve a level of proficiency that is essentially impossible to achieve in a short workshop; further practice is required on the part of the learner, and that practice represents an up-front investment that must be well motivated. They do not, however, require us to become master software developers. Just as every scientist need not be a publishing statistician but should have a firm grasp of the statistical methods used to analyze data in their field, we want to introduce the skills and ideas that support our goal, without abandoning pragmatism.</p>

        <p>So - a few questions fall to us as instructors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How can we introduce new ideas in a systematic way, that makes them usable as quickly as possible?</li>
          <li>What do we have to do to build fluency in these ideas, without overshooting into the realm of mastery?</li>
          <li>How can we build and manage motivation to keep students engaged while they invest in practicing with these new ideas?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this lesson, we'll address the first two by learning how to build functional representations of knowledge, and thinking about the nature of fluency and mastery.</p>

<!-- Concept Maps -->
        <h1 id='A-Cartoon-of-Knowledge'>A Cartoon of Knowledge</h1>
        <p>Two things are required to paint even the most elementary picture of knowledge:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Ideas.</strong> The core concepts themselves, like the filesystem, a command, or a variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Connections</strong> between ideas. The linkages that allow us to infer, construct lines of logic, and build functioning methodologies. A shell command is related to the filesystem, for example, via its executional context.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We can cast a useful abstraction of learning as the construction of these graphs of ideas and connections.</p>

<!-- Expertise -->
