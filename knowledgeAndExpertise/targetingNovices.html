      <h2>One of the most important transformations in learning is the initial acquisition of a functional mental model of a topic. In this exercise, learners will try to zoom in on the foundations of their topic, and practice teaching them.</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Review the concepts maps you made in the previous exercise; what are the core concepts and relationships that a student must learn in order to have a functional knowledge of the topic? Highlight this core knowledge on your concept map, and devise a three minute lesson to teach a part of it - preferably a new section you haven't yet tried to teach (10 min).</li>
            <li>Assemble new groups of three, and perform the same teaching / listening / filming activity as in the last exercise. After each, discuss how the core concepts identified for each lesson support a basic mental model of the topic - could even more drastic simplifications be made? (15 min)</li>
            <li>Afterwards, discuss with the class the challenge of trimming content down to the bare essentials.</li>

            After this lesson, learners should be familiar with identifying the core concepts in a concept map, and restricting their teaching to just reflect this content.
